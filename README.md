This AddOn will Create and if already exists Edit a specific Macro (Default: MageFoodMacro) in your "General Macro" Section.  
This Macro will be edited at different Events to always use the highest Mage Conjured Food from your Inventory!  
This Macro (by default) also will cast "Conjure Refreshment" on Right-Click but this can be disabled if you want by command line (see below).  

You can customize with the following Slash-Commands:
|Slash Command(s)|Description|
|--- |--- |
|/mfm or /mfm help|show "Help Message"|
|/mfm name or n <MacroName>|change the Macro Name that is used by the AddOn (Default: MageFoodMacro)|
|/mfm conjure or cast or c|toggle "cast Conjure Refreshment when Right-Click the Macro"|

You can also use /magefoodmacro if the /mfm conflict with another AddOn.
